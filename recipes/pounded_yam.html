    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h6>Pounded yam is a traditional West African dish made from the yam, a root vegetable.</h6>
    <p>The yam is peeled and boiled until it becomes soft, and then it is pounded in a mortar and pestle or with a
        machine called a "pounding machine" to make it smooth and pliable.
    </p>
    <p>The result is a starchy, slightly sweet dough-like substance that can be formed into various shapes and served with a variety of stews, soups, and sauces.
        It is popular in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, Togo, and Sierra Leone.
