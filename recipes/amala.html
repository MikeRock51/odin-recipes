    <img class="col-11 mb-3" src="../assets/amala p.jpg" alt="Wrapped Amalas on while plate">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h6>Àmàlà is a staple food native to the Yoruba ethnic group of Southwestern Nigeria.</h6>
    <p>It is made of yam, cassava flour, or unripe plantain flour.
        Tubers of yams are peeled, sliced, cleaned, dried and then ground into flour.
        It is also called èlùbọ́. Yams are white in colour but turn brown when dried which gives àmàlà its colour.
    <p>It is a popular side dish served with ewédú and gbẹ̀gìrì (black-eyed beans soup),
        but is also served with a variety of other ọbẹ (soups), such as ẹ̀fọ́ ilá, and ogbono.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Boiled Water</li>
        <li>Elubo</li>
        <li>A little bit of energy</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First, heat water on the fire and allow boiling.</li>
        <li>After that, bring it down from the fire and gradually add your elubo.
            (Do not add the yam flour to the water while still on the fire so it doesn’t form lumps).
        </li>
        <li>Then, turn the yam flour with a wooden turning stick (omorogun) quickly so as not to form lumps.</li>
        <li>Turn for a while, add little water and put it back on the fire to cook on low heat for about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Finally, after 5 minutes, begin to turn the Àmàlà again, keep turning until a smooth paste is formed.
            The pulling of the dough into a smooth paste is the most difficult part of making Amala.
        </li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy with soup of choice</li>
    </ol>
